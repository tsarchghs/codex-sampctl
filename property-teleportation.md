# Property teleportation

Feature showcase: Property teleportation

## Information

Every game has its limitations and GTA:V is sadly not an exception. Seeing as the game wasn't intended to be transformed into a roleplay universe, there will be areas of interest that's out of reach for players. This includes places like balconies, getting behind the counter of a bar to bartend, backdoors and so forth. As this would obviously limit the players ability to roleplay in certain scenarios we made a new “smart teleportation system” that does exactly what you would expect.

It simple allows you to teleport back and forth between two points.

## In-game usage

Property teleports are marked with a green pickup and a floating label. Walk into the marker to move between the paired entry and exit points. You can also use `/teleports` for a quick reminder.

Thanks to norrig for providing a few clips to showcase.

## How do I get this for my property?

To get teleports fitted for your property you'll need to request it from the Property Management being led by @norrig.
