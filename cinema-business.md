# Cinema Business

## Summary

The cinema script lets business owners broadcast a YouTube video to all players who are attending. The video stays synchronized for everyone who joins or leaves during the broadcast. Players can press **Y** at the business point to start watching.

## Setup

Cinema owners must set up a custom interior for the cinema script to work. The interior needs:

- A screen
- A set of chairs

After placing the seats, run `/reloadcinema` so the seats and screen are detected. This only needs to happen when changes are made; the script will auto-detect after a restart.

## Accepted Objects

### Screens

- Cinema Screen

### Seats

- Red Armchair 1
- Red Armchair 2
- Cinema Chair
