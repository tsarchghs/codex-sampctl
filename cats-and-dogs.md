# Cats & Dogs

Feature showcase post from the GTA World Forums for the GTA V heavy roleplay
server.

## Information

GTA:World is proud to present our unique pet system for the community. This is
an entirely unique feature that is completely synced with everyone no matter
the task your pet is assigned. With our own syncing of peds we give the players
the opportunity to experience some really immersive roleplay! There are 5 types
of dogs and 1 cat you can own.

## Available tasks

- Follow me — the dog will follow its owner around.
- Come to me — the dog runs to your position.
- Idle/Stay — the dog will stay put and await further instructions.
- Wander around — the dog will wander off on its own within 50 meters of you
  (dog only).
- Sit — the dog will sit down.
- Bark — the dog will bark a couple of times (dog only).

## How to get one?

In order to avoid the server being swarmed with pets, and since it's only a
cosmetic feature, the server offers it to donators only. This will drastically
reduce the potential amount of pet owners, while financially helping the server
which only relies on cosmetic features for its donations. These features must
remain with a high and monthly price to prevent having too many owners and
stacking more and more owners with time. Once again, this is all cosmetic. If
you wish to support us feel free to, no one forces you to get a pet. The goal is
to avoid the server being swarmed with pets, hence the decision.
