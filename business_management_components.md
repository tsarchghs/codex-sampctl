## Businesses for sale

You can buy the following business types:

- Ammunation
- Clothing shop
- 24/7
- Barbershop
- Beauty salon
- Plastic surgeon

When a business is for sale, its price is printed at its location. You can also see the list of businesses for sale in your personal menu.

Once bought, you can manage your business by pressing **Y**.

You earn all money spent by players in your business, except for weapons where a 50% fee is taken by the government.

## Component management

When a player buys an item in your business, the components amount decreases. Once it reaches 0, your business cannot be used anymore. You must recruit components truckers who will deliver components bought at the component warehouse. You can set a high purchase price for components to have a quick delivery.

## Components trucker flow

1. Buy crates at the component warehouse for **$500** each.
2. Load the crates into your car.
3. Check the purchase price for each business.
4. Select the business you want to deliver to; a GPS marker is added to your map.
