## Information

There's nothing more dull than having the world around you feel static and not interactable. That's why we'd like to introduce a whole new system which allows you to interact with a lot more objects throughout the gameworld. Vending machines are now a thing and a place to buy sodas and your daily snack! Below you'll find images of all the different vending machines to purchase new items from. You simply press Y and if you're close enough to any of them a standard buy menu will appear just as you're accustomed with from any other shop.

## What's to come?

We'd love to put this new system to good use and offer you a wide variety of features such as fridges, clothing drawers and so on. Norrig was quick to come up with new ideas on how to further utilize it. Some might have noticed the last vending machine that offers coffee is not on the list at the moment. Once we got a good idea on how to implement coffee into the game it will of course be put to use.
