## Drugs

- **Marijuana**: Gives a light screen effect for a few minutes, then heals and increases health to **115 HP** (200 HP maximum). The HP bonus depends on current addiction—the more addicted you are, the more marijuana you’ll need.
- **Cocaine**: Gives a strong screen effect for a few minutes, then increases health by **50 HP** (200 HP maximum). The HP bonus depends on current addiction—the more addicted you are, the more cocaine you’ll need.
- **Heroin**: Gives a strong screen effect for a few minutes, then allows carrying **+2 kg** in inventory (up to **10 kg**). The bonus depends on current addiction—the more addicted you are, the more heroin you’ll need.
- **Methadone**: Supplied by the Los Santos Fire Department to treat addiction. You must apply for a program and be treated regularly.

## Addiction

- Addiction increases by **1** with every drug usage, except for marijuana (one chance out of five) and methadone.
- Addiction decreases every **3 hours**, or can be reduced using methadone.
- Once addiction reaches **50**, players spawn with **50 HP** and health decreases faster over time.
- All drug bonuses are decreased depending on addiction, forcing increased usage as addiction grows.

## How to Obtain Drugs

- **Marijuana**: Obtainable by planting seeds and growing plants (feature showcase pending).
- **All other drugs**: Imported and must be found through roleplay means only.
