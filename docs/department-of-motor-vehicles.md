## Feature Showcase

### Information

With the brand new Department of Motor Vehicles we'd like to introduce a complex way of handling and managing player vehicles. Noone wants to watch your everyday gangster driving down the hood in a modern sports car. That's one of the main reasons as to why we decided to implement the Department of Motor Vehicles. This is the place to register your vehicle, pay road taxes or get your vehicle insured. They are also responsible for handling the paperwork that produces you a unique numberplate associated with your vehicle.

### Pricing

It's not cheap to register your vehicle, but it is however highly recommended as driving around without is against the law of San Andreas. The prices are as follows:

- Registering your vehicle to get a numberplate is 20% of the vehicles market value
- Paying your road taxes varies depending on the vehicle class but is by default set to 5%
- Getting your vehicle insured costs 5% as a one time fee. After that it's lowered to a fixed amount each paycheck

### Billing and Enforcement

Each paycheck you'll be billed for your vehicle insurance, and the price depends on the vehicle class. Sports cars are more expensive to keep insured compared to a compact etc. Every week you'll also get billed due to road taxes, and if you're unable to pay your vehicle is flagged as such, which the ALPR (Automatic License-Plate Recognition) from the LSPD is able to detect. So watch out! Now you may ask, why would I even get an insurance to begin with. The insurance company will pay you bill incase your vehicle gets destroyed. Should you not have an insurance by the time your vehicle is destroyed you'll have to pay the bill yourself.
